Naming Your Startup: A Practical Rulebook
1. Infuse Personal Meaning or Vision

Principle: Start with something that resonates with your own story or the mission of your company.

Examples:

Tesla: Named after Nikola Tesla, symbolizing innovation and groundbreaking technology.

Amazon: Chosen to evoke a sense of something vast and all-encompassing, aligning with the vision of being the biggest bookstore (and later the biggest marketplace).

2. Keep It Simple and Memorable

Principle: Choose names that are easy to pronounce, spell, and remember. Descriptive or familiar words can help.

Examples:

Microsoft: A blend of "microcomputer" and "software," directly hinting at the company’s focus.

Facebook: A literal name for a social network of faces, making it instantly recognizable.

3. Leverage Phonetic Appeal

Principle: Consider how the name sounds when spoken. Names that roll off the tongue or have a rhythmic quality can be more appealing.

Examples:

Zomato: Ends with an "o," giving it a playful, easy-to-say sound. Many successful brands (like "Trello" or "Solo") use this kind of ending to sound catchy and friendly.

4. Use Evocative or Metaphorical Names

Principle: Select names that evoke a certain image, emotion, or metaphor rather than being literal. This can give the brand a unique identity.

Examples:

Apple: A simple, everyday word that stands out in the tech industry and feels approachable.

Oracle: Suggests wisdom and insight, which aligns well with a data and software company.
